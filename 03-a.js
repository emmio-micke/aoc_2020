/*
Let's look at this row by row.

The map function will walk through every row (every value in the array) and return a new array with
the calculated value for each "old" value. In this case, row will contain one row pattern, like so:
....##.#..###.#.........#...##.

Since the pattern is repeating, we'll have to repeat it for as long as needed for each row.
Needed:
Row: ....##.#..###.#.........#...##.
Length of row: 31
No of rows: 323
So, for the rows to be long enough, they need to be 323 * 3 chars long (for every step down we take, we take three
to the right). And since each row is 31 chars, we need to repeat the string (323 / 31) * 3 times.
We use the map method to do this with every row.

let tree_counter = map
    .map(row => row.repeat(Math.ceil((map.length / row.length) * 3)))

Here, we get the character from each row that we're interested in. Index will have the index of the value we're
looking at in the array at the moment (0, 1, 2, 3 etc) and since we move three steps to the right each time,
we want the character at index * 3.
    .map((row, index) => row[index * 3])

We'll filter out all the characters in the new array that has a tree character. That is, our new array will
keep all the elements from the "old" array that consist of the #-char.
    .filter(char => '#' === char)

... and then we take the length of the new array.
    .length;

*/

let tree_counter = map
    .map(row => row.repeat(Math.ceil((map.length / row.length) * 3)))
    .map((row, index) => row[index * 3])
    .filter(char => '#' === char)
    .length;


/*

Alternate solution:
I started out with this one, wanting it to be easy to read and follow, but got triggered to solve it in a shorter way.

// See above.
map = map.map(row => row.repeat(Math.ceil((map.length / row.length) * 3)))

let x = 0, y = 0, tree_counter = 0;

Step 1 step down, 3 steps right. Check char at that position.
for (let x = 0, y = 0; y < map.length ; x +=3, y++) {
    if ('#' === map[y][x]) {
        tree_counter++;
    }
}
*/

console.log(tree_counter); // 289
